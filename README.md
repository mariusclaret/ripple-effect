# Ripple Effect

Get a beautiful Material Design ripple effect in pure JavaScript for your website in less than 1 minute. The script is not blocking rendering on the first paint, because the effect only gets fired on `onpointerdown` and `onpointerup` events on the `document`.

## Getting Started

Import the **ripple.js** file in your project:
```html
<script src="ripple.js"></script>
```

Add **ripple class** to your element:
```html
<button class="ripple">Button with ripple effect</button>
```

Done!

## Demo

Works only in browsers with pointer events support.
